## About this project 

This is a shopping cart web app for a mock local farm shop :tomato:

It uses **local storage** which means that items added to the cart will stay in the cart even when: 
- the page is refreshed
- the tab is closed and another tab is opened

This app allows you to:

- Add items to the cart
- Increase and decrease the quantity of each item selected
- View all items added to the cart
- View the total number of items in the cart
- View the total price of all items in the cart
- Displays a message when the cart is empty

This app protects from: 
- The item quantity being edited in any other way than through the increase and decrease buttons
- It is not possible to put a minus number as a quantity
- The code for the input buttons is not done using innerHTML, protecting from cross site scripting

## Responsiveness

This is a fully responsive web app adaptable to mobile, ipad and desktop.
