## Project Objectives

With this project, I wanted to practice my front end skills. Specifically, I wanted to practice:

### Designing 
- To create an inviting website with a colour scheme that reflects the nature element of a farm shop. 

### Local Storage with JavaScript
- To ensure that the shopping cart items persist in the shopping cart, even if the page is refreshed or the tab is closed and then reopened

### Responsiveness
- To create a fully responsive website that is adaptable to mobile, ipad and desktop

## Features 

This app allows you to:

- Add items to the cart
- Increase and decrease the quantity of each item selected
- View all items added to the cart
- View the total number of items in the cart
- View the total price of all items in the cart
- Displays a message when the cart is empty

### Mobile: 

Item being added to the cart in mobile view:

### Desktop 

Desktop shopping cart open view:

## Protection 
- The item quantity being edited in any other way than through the increase and decrease buttons
- It is not possible to put a minus number as a quantity
- The code for the input buttons is not done using innerHTML, protecting from cross site scripting
