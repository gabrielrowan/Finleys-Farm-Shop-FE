## Project Objectives

With this project, I wanted to practice my front end skills. Specifically, I wanted to practice:

### Designing 
- To create an inviting website with a colour scheme that reflects the nature element of a farm shop. 

### Local Storage with JavaScript
- To ensure that the shopping cart items persist in the shopping cart, even if the page is refreshed or the tab is closed and then reopened

### Responsiveness
- To create a fully responsive website that is adaptable to mobile, ipad and desktop

## Design

The colour scheme for this website: 

![blue](https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/#67755D

<img valign='middle' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/#67755D?style=round' alt='beige'/> 
<img valign='middle' src='https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/#EA9944?style=round' alt='orange'/> 



This is a shopping cart web app for a mock local farm shop :tomato:

It uses **local storage** which means that items added to the cart will stay in the cart even when: 
- the page is refreshed
- the tab is closed and another tab is opened

This app allows you to:

- Add items to the cart
- Increase and decrease the quantity of each item selected
- View all items added to the cart
- View the total number of items in the cart
- View the total price of all items in the cart
- Displays a message when the cart is empty

This app protects from: 
- The item quantity being edited in any other way than through the increase and decrease buttons
- It is not possible to put a minus number as a quantity
- The code for the input buttons is not done using innerHTML, protecting from cross site scripting


### Mobile:
